### What is this section for? ###
----
* This section is for any Java projects that I have completed either in classes or during my own time

### Projects located here ###
----
* Array List and Binary Search Tree Implementation: Made up of 3 files, 2 custom classes: ListArray and Tree to
represent Array Lists and Binary Search Trees, and a main file to test my custom classes. This was done to help
my class better understand these data structures and how they work.
* Merge Sort Implementation: Implemented merge sort in java with a main class to test it
* Linked List and Array List Implementation: Made up of 3 files, 2 custom classes: ListArray and ListLinked to represent
Array Lists and Linked Lists, and a main file to test my custom classes. This was also done to help my class better
understand these data structures and how they work
* RodCuttingAlgorithm: Implemented the Rod cutting algorithm in a main.java file
* Sorting Implementation: Implemented Counting Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Radix Sort, and Simple Sort
and various other files to test each sort file
* List Abstract Datatype Implementation: Implements the List abstract datatype on the Custom classes Song.java and
SongList.java and testing files to test the list storage accuracy of these two custom classes
* Ordered List Implementation: Implements the ordered list data type and tests it both normally and recursively in
3 different test files
* Structure Types Implementation: Implements the Queue, Array List, Simple, Stack, and Binary Trees to better understand
each of the data types for my own custom classes. Also includes test files to test each of the structures.
