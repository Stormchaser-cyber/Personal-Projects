# README - Bot Projects #

This directory contains python3 scripts which provide functionality for different bot ideas.

### What is this repository for? ###

* The scripts here can be used for personal curiosity, practice, and overall fun!
* Version 0.1 - 14 July, 2021

### How do I get set up? ###

* Each python file (module) should contain the code to operate individually either as a Unix-style 
 command line utility or through a GUI (graphical user interface). Some may contain code that acts 
 only as utility functions, and some may contain tests.
* All files must be written in python3.

### What is here? ###

* TODO.md: A list of bot ideas and things to implement
* README.md: General notes about what this directory is for and how to use it (This file)
