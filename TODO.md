# TODO - Bot Projects Python #

Here are some ideas for python data processing programs

* Web Scraper for Stock data - A program that scrapes web data for stock market data to use for the stock exachange
  bot. Should save information into either a spreadsheet or a csv file. (Runs during the market time 8am - 5pm).

* Stock Exchange Bot - An automatic program that runs in the background that plays a stock trading game (for now),
  it operates by having an initial sample amount of cash, taking in the stock prices every 30 minutes, compares it
  to the 3 month previous price of the stock as well as the buying price to determine to hold onto the stock or to
  sell the stock. It should also keep track and set aside tax money for each sale. Taxes = 50% of profit if stock 
  was held for under 2 years and 15% of profit if stock was held for 2 years or more.

* Currency Exchange Bot - An automatic program that runs in the background that plays a currency trading game 
  (for now), it operates by having an initial sample amount of cash, taking in the currency exchange prices every
  30 minutes and comparing it to the 1 month previous price of the stock as well as the buying price to determine
  whether or not to exchange it back, put more in, or to hold its' current position. Taxes won't be factored in yet
  as I'm not sure what Taxes apply to currency exchange when operating from inside the U.S.

* Video Game Bot - A program that plays through a specific single player game (not sure which game yet) to grind for
  additional loot/money/items.
